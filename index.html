							The small beach town of Agnes Water, Australia is
							the first place where I parked up in Spoons; my
							34-year old campervan turned portable music studio
							&amp; mobile home. After 5 years of my corporate
							job, I set off with her into the wild to unlock the
							music I knew was stuck inside me
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							One night, early into this new journey, I dreamed of
							the intro to my album. I heard a flute soaring above
							sounds from my roots (India). The very next day, I
							met an Aussie man named Shane; parked by the beach,
							playing the Indian Bansuri flute, sipping chai, and
							reading about Hindu gods. Would you believe it?
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							I walked up to Shane and shared my recent dream with
							him. I asked him if I may record with him in my
							studio on wheels. He kindly accepted. What you hear
							is our first interaction, before he played the flute
							on Platform 1 - the exact intro I dreamt of.

							begins with our days of innocent laughter in

							moves into a darker tune - when no one could speak
							to Sam, before developing into something uplifting
							and inspiring, just like Sam’s journey.

							Blessings in Disguise is about a run that changed my
							life
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							Inspired by my moment of clarity, I felt compelled
							to leave my life in Sydney behind; my job,
							belongings, a relationship - so I could join my
							dream music school in Los Angeles and chase the
							music inside of me
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							That’s when the pandemic arrived and crushed dreams,
							including mine. When my world felt like it was
							crashing down around me - I went for a run and
							something else took over. I felt a fire at the base
							of my belly. This is portrayed in the second half of
							the music as a ‘phone call from grit’ (by featured
							artist ‘Sibu’)
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							With my newfound strength, I started on my journey
							and all of the insurmountable problems seemed to
							slowly resolve. My job dissolved into a redundancy
							payment, my lack of belongings enabled nomadism and
							heartbreak turned to forgiveness. Perhaps the best
							outcome of all was that my faraway music school
							welcomed me as an online student - allowing me to
							learn from anywhere
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							Suddenly, I found myself living the dream that I saw
							in my moment of clarity. I converted an old
							campervan into a portable music studio &amp; mobile
							home named “Spoons.” I was composing tunes from
							beautiful places as I explored Queensland,
							Australia. And I tasted a nomadic freedom that I
							would soon become addicted to. Looking back, I
							believe all those problems were ‘blessings in
							disguise’ carefully placed to get me right where I
							was meant to be
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							Friends, if you’re taking your leap of faith but are
							facing problems….remember, that those problems may
							not be problems at all. They may simply be
							‘blessings in disguise.’
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							So breathe deep, put this song on and just. keep.
							on. running

							The campfire at our hostel in Agnes Water pulled in

							Koehler, a trained German pianist. We both shared a
							fascination for composing original music and a
							boredom with traditional methods. She was just
							passing through..so we said goodbye, joking that we
							would meet &amp; record music together in the
							future. Little did I know that she was one of the
							best players I had ever met. And little did we know
							how our paths would continue to cross across two
							continents.

							Months later, Esther &amp; I found ourselves in
							neighboring towns further up the road, in the
							Atherton Tablelands. We realised we had musical
							chemistry, and she agreed to help me record a piano
							version of my song, Stare. We found a piano thanks
							to Nick’s Pizzeria, in Yungaburra. I played her my
							song, and explained the story, piece by piece. MIDI
							was translated into sheet music, and finally - into
							Esther’s own notation
						</p>
						<p class="accordion__body">
							Then, I stepped back and watched a professional
							pianist play music I’d written. This was a big
							moment for me - the first time I truly felt like a
							composer. Esther, thank you for bringing my piece to
							life.
